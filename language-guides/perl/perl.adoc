[#neo4p-rest]
== REST::Neo4p

The Perl driver from Mark Jensen is always up to date with the latest Neo4j API developments, and it's fun to use too.
It works with the Neo4jâ€™s REST API by using Perl5 objects in a consistent, idiomatic Perl-style.

== Neo4j::Driver

This is a Perl driver by Arne Johannessen. It enables interacting with a Neo4j server using the same classes and method calls as the official Neo4j drivers.  It also has experimental support for HTTPS and Bolt.
